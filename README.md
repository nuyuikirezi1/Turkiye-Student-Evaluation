## Problem Title:
Turkiye Student Performance Prediction Based on Course Evaluation Data

```
```
## 🎯 Problem Statement
> How can we predict course satisfaction and identify patterns related to students repeating courses based on their feedback and demographics?

This project analyzes a dataset from a university in Turkiye. It uses 28 question-based evaluation responses, plus metadata such as attendance, course difficulty, and instructor.

Understanding the factors that influence student academic success is crucial for improving learning outcomes. In this project, we analyze a dataset of student evaluations from a university in Turkey. The dataset includes attributes such as attendance, difficulty level, number of classes, and various course-related ratings. The goal is to predict the success or failure of a student in a course and identify the most significant factors affecting their performance.

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard Highlights

- 🎯 Repeats by Instructor (Bar Chart)
- 📊 Attendance vs Repeat Count (Column Chart)
- 📈 Average Satisfaction by Class (Line Chart)
- 🧠 AI Visual: Key Influencers to explain `Repeat Count`
- 🎛️ Slicers: Instructor, Class, Attendance, Difficulty
- 💬 Tooltips for extra hover information
- 📦 Cards: Total Students, Avg Satisfaction, Total Repeats

---

## ✨ Innovative Features Used
- `AvgSatisfaction` as a calculated DAX measure
